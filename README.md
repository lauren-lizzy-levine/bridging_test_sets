# bridging_test_sets
Harmonized test sets for GUM (V10.1.0), GENTLE (V2.0.0), and ARRAU

We harmonize on the following three points: categorical differences regarding the scope of bridging, categories for entity types, and bridging subtype annotations (as desbribed in our paper (TBA)).

Due to licensing constraints, the token text has been removed from the ARRAU data and the GUM Reddit data.
